#Resolved process#

Remove the whole directory - vendor
#1: rm -rf vendor                                                                                               

Remove the file composer.lock
#2: unlink composer.lock

Clear composer cache
#3: composer clearcache

Execute command - composer Install 
#4: composer install

After all, excute the same command - php artisan Workerman:start

The right way, fixed and done.
